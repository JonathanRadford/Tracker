Task Tracker - 

This is a Ticket Tracker that we have created using React.

We need to create components that would utilise Props, States, as well as Functions. Using these we would take the user data, map through the arrays and print to the page their names and jobs, whilst adding in a counter that could add or minus depending on whether or not a task was completed.
